# KOOMPI OS: AI-Powered Computing with Model Context Protocol

**April 2025**

## Abstract

KOOMPI OS integrates AI at the system level by implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized mechanism for applications to interact with AI models while maintaining context across sessions. Built on Arch Linux, the system uses a tiered approach to AI models, running smaller models locally for common tasks while offering optional cloud processing for complex operations. The architecture preserves user privacy through local-first processing and strict data boundaries.

Core components include a Rust-based desktop environment, an assistant for natural language interaction, an intelligent CLI for system management, and productivity applications. The system maintains contextual awareness across applications, enabling consistent user experiences and more effective task completion.

This paper describes the technical architecture, implementation approach, and development roadmap for KOOMPI OS.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol provides a standardized mechanism for system components to interact with AI models while maintaining contextual awareness across sessions and applications.

### Core Components

1. **Context Store**: Maintains user, system, and task context with hierarchical design and access controls
2. **Model Router**: Directs requests to appropriate AI models based on task requirements and available resources
3. **Memory Manager**: Handles storage and retrieval of contextual information
4. **Schema Validator**: Ensures proper formatting of inputs, outputs, and context updates
5. **Tool Integration**: Allows models to safely interact with system functions

### Model Tiers

- **Tier 1**: Small, specialized models for common tasks (local execution)
- **Tier 2**: Medium-sized general models (local execution)
- **Tier 3**: Large, high-capability models (optional cloud execution)

### Key Interactions

1. **Context Retrieval**: `GET /context?scope=user&relevance=high&query="system update"`
2. **Model Invocation**:
   ```
   POST /model/invoke
   {
     "model": "local/general-v1",
     "query": "How do I update my system?",
     "context_id": "ctx_12345",
     "tools": ["package_manager", "system_info"]
   }
   ```
