You are a blockchain engineer and cryptography expert, tasked with translating the conceptual design of the Selendra Neural Network (SNN) into a more concrete, implementable blueprint. For each major section and sub-section of the SNN Conceptual Design Document (provided below for reference), please provide a detailed analysis focusing on **implementability**.

Your response should address, but not be limited to, the following aspects for each area:

- **Specific Algorithms & Data Structures:** What specific algorithms (e.g., for consensus rounds, transaction selection, slashing conditions, fee calculation, state proof generation) and data structures (e.g., for the DAG, account states, smart contract storage, validator sets) would you propose? Justify your choices.
- **Protocol Details & Message Flows:** Outline key protocol interactions and message flows. For instance, detail the steps and messages involved in transaction submission, propagation, validation, consensus, finality, cross-DSC communication, or asset bridging.
- **Cryptographic Primitives:** Identify the specific cryptographic primitives required (e.g., signature schemes, hash functions, ZK-SNARK/STARK constructions, MPC protocols, threshold encryption schemes). Discuss their suitability, security assumptions, and potential performance implications.
- **Component Breakdown:** What are the primary software components or modules that would need to be developed (e.g., P2P networking layer, consensus engine, execution environment, state database, RPC interface, bridging modules, governance contracts)?
- **Implementation Challenges & Trade-offs:** What are the most significant engineering challenges anticipated for implementing this part of the SNN? Discuss any critical trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. security, complexity vs. decentralization, flexibility vs. efficiency) and how you might approach them.
- **Security Considerations (Implementation Specific):** Beyond the conceptual security measures, what specific implementation-level security vulnerabilities or attack vectors should be considered for this section, and how would you propose to mitigate them?
- **Parameterization & Configuration:** What key parameters would need to be defined and tuned for this component (e.g., stake amounts, committee sizes, round times, fee constants, slashing penalties)? How might these be determined or adjusted?
- **Integration Points:** How does this section integrate with other parts of the SNN? Define key interfaces and dependencies.
- **Research & Prototyping Needs:** Are there any areas within this section that require further research or a proof-of-concept prototype before full-scale implementation?
- **Comparison with Existing Implementations:** If relevant, briefly compare your proposed implementation approach for specific features with how similar features are implemented in existing L1s/L2s, highlighting SNN's innovations or learning.

**Please structure your response by addressing each of the following sections from the SNN Conceptual Design Document:**
