## What is KHRt?

KHRt is a digital version of the Cambodian riel that works on blockchain networks. Think of it as programmable digital cash that represents real Cambodian riel held safely in banks, designed to work alongside Cambodia's existing payment systems.

**Key Facts:**
- 1 KHRt = 1 Cambodian Riel (always)
- Backed by real money in Cambodian banks
- Works 24/7, even when banks are closed
- Available on multiple blockchain networks
- Fully regulated and compliant
- Complements Bakong and other payment systems

## Cambodia's Payment Success Story
