# KHRt: The Cambodian Riel on Blockchain

## Executive Summary

KHRt is a fully-backed digital token that represents the Cambodian riel (KHR) on blockchain networks. Each KHRt token is backed 1:1 by KHR held in regulated financial institutions, enabling programmable riel-denominated transactions across multiple blockchains. While the National Bank of Cambodia's Bakong system serves interbank settlement within a permissioned environment, KHRt extends the riel's utility to the broader blockchain ecosystem.

**Key Value Proposition:**
- Enables programmable riel-denominated value transfers across public blockchains
- Maintains 1:1 peg with full reserve backing and 5% safety buffer
- Provides transparent reserve verification through cryptographic proofs
- Offers cross-chain interoperability with major blockchain networks
- Delivers regulatory compliance with Cambodian and international standards

## Market Opportunity

Cambodia's financial system presents several opportunities that KHRt addresses:

**Dollarization Challenge:** 68% of transactions in Cambodia are conducted in USD despite government de-dollarization initiatives. KHRt provides a digital alternative that extends the riel's utility.

**Remittance Market:** Cambodia receives $1.2 billion in annual remittances with current fees averaging 5.4% and 2-5 day processing times. KHRt reduces fees to 0.5% with 15-minute settlement.

**Financial Inclusion Gap:** Despite high mobile penetration (124%), only 33% of Cambodians have access to banking. KHRt provides 24/7 digital access to riel-denominated value.

**Cross-Border Payment Friction:** International payments face high costs (3-7%) and long settlement times (2-5 days). KHRt enables near-instant, low-cost cross-border transactions.

## Technology & Implementation

KHRt is built on a secure, scalable architecture:

**Reserve Management:** Full collateralization plus a 5% safety buffer, with reserves held across multiple regulated financial institutions (maximum 30% per institution).

**Security Framework:** Multi-layer protection including formal verification, multi-signature controls, and regular independent audits.

**Cross-Chain Capability:** Operates primarily on Selendra Network with bridges to major blockchains, enabling seamless interoperability.

**Implementation Timeline:**

1. **Foundation (Months 1-3):** Legal structure, core contracts, banking partnerships
2. **Limited Launch (Months 4-6):** Institutional pilot with 5 billion KHR initial reserve
3. **Public Expansion (Months 7-12):** Public access, mobile integration, cross-chain bridges
4. **Ecosystem Growth (Months 13-24):** Developer tools, international corridors, enterprise APIs
5. **Advanced Features (Months 25-36):** Expanded blockchain support, specialized solutions

## Business Model

KHRTrust, the entity managing KHRt, generates revenue through:

- Transaction fees (0.1-0.5% depending on volume and tier)
- Interest income from a portion of reserves (subject to regulatory approval)
- Enterprise API and integration services
- Premium service fees for institutional clients

The model ensures long-term sustainability while maintaining the security and stability of the KHRt system, with a commitment to maintaining a 24-month operational runway at all times.

## Key Applications

**Cross-Border Payments:** Reduces remittance costs from 5.4% to 0.5% with settlement in minutes rather than days.

**Supply Chain Finance:** Enables smart contract escrow and programmable milestone payments for Cambodia's $6.2 billion export market.

**Agricultural Sector:** Provides weather-triggered conditional payments and automated insurance claims for farmers.

**Small Business Payments:** Offers automated supplier payments and programmable recurring payments for Cambodia's 580,000 MSMEs.

**Cryptocurrency Market Access:** Creates a regulated on/off-ramp between KHR and cryptocurrencies with lower fees and transparent pricing.

- **Reserve Protection:** Diversification across institutions, 5% reserve buffer, insurance coverage
- **Technical Safeguards:** Regular security audits, bug bounty program, open-source code review
