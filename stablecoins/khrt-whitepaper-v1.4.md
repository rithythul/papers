# KHRt: A Digital Token for the Cambodian Riel

_Whitepaper v1.4 – May 2025_  
_By Selendra Team_

## Abstract

We present KHRt, a blockchain-based digital token representing the Cambodian riel. Each KHRt token is backed 1:1 by KHR held in regulated financial institutions. The system uses cryptographic proofs to verify reserves and enables programmable payments while maintaining regulatory compliance. KHRt extends the riel's utility to multiple blockchain networks through independent deployments, avoiding bridge vulnerabilities while complementing Cambodia's existing payment infrastructure.

## 1. Introduction

Cambodia's digital payment landscape has experienced remarkable transformation. The National Bank of Cambodia's Bakong system has achieved exceptional adoption with 30 million wallets (1.69x the population) and processed $104.81 billion in transactions during 2024—representing 330% of GDP. Bakong enables instant domestic transfers and has integrated with international systems including Alipay, WeChat Pay, and UnionPay for cross-border payments.

Despite these advances, opportunities remain for enhanced programmability and blockchain ecosystem integration. While Bakong excels at instant peer-to-peer transfers and QR code payments, KHRt addresses distinct use cases requiring smart contract functionality, 24/7 operations beyond banking infrastructure, and native blockchain ecosystem participation.

KHRt complements rather than competes with existing payment systems. Where Bakong provides domestic instant transfers and cross-border corridors, KHRt enables programmable money applications, decentralized finance participation, and global blockchain network access while maintaining full regulatory compliance.

## 2. System Design

### 2.1 Core Principles

KHRt operates on five fundamental principles:

1. **Full Reserve Backing**: Every token is backed by at least one riel in reserve
2. **Cryptographic Verification**: Reserve balances are proven using zero-knowledge proofs
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: All operations follow Cambodian and international regulations
4. **Infrastructure Complementarity**: Works alongside existing payment systems rather than replacing them
5. **Operational Transparency**: System state and reserves are publicly verifiable

### 2.2 Reserve Formula

The system maintains reserves according to:

```
R ≥ C × (1 + B)
```

Where:
- R = Total reserves in KHR
- C = Circulating token supply
- B = Buffer percentage (minimum 5%)

This ensures over-collateralization and protects against operational risks.

### 2.3 Token Lifecycle

```
KHR Deposit → Reserve Verification → Token Mint → Circulation → Burn Request → KHR Withdrawal
```

1. User deposits KHR at authorized institution
2. Institution notifies system with cryptographic proof
3. Smart contract mints equivalent KHRt tokens
4. Tokens circulate on blockchain networks
5. User burns tokens to initiate redemption
6. Institution releases equivalent KHR

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Smart Contract Architecture

The system uses upgradeable smart contracts with role-based access control:

```solidity
contract KHRtToken {
    // Core token functionality
    function mint(address to, uint256 amount, bytes32 proof) external;
    function burn(uint256 amount) external;
    
    // Reserve verification
    function updateReserveProof(bytes32 merkleRoot, uint256 reserves) external;
    function verifyReserveProof(uint256 amount, bytes32[] proof) external view;
    
    // Safety mechanisms
    function pause() external; // Emergency stop
}
```

### 3.2 Integration with Existing Payment Infrastructure

KHRt integrates with Cambodia's payment ecosystem through Baray's aggregated banking API platform:

**About Baray:**
Baray is an Integrated Payment Environment. Baray simplifies banking connection and bridges finance to blockchain.

**Baray Integration Architecture:**
- **Banking API Aggregation**: Baray consolidates commercial bank APIs already connected to Bakong
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Accepts both KHR and USD deposits through existing banking infrastructure
- **Automated Processing**: Seamless conversion from traditional banking to blockchain tokens
- **Upfront Fee Transparency**: All costs displayed before transaction confirmation

**Mint/Burn Process Flow:**
```
User Deposit → Baray Payment Routes → KHRTrust Bank Accounts → Smart Contract Signal → Token Mint/Burn
```

1. **User Initiates**: Selects amount and target blockchain network
2. **Baray Processing**: Routes KHR or USD through partner bank APIs to KHRTrust accounts
3. **Reserve Verification**: Confirms deposit in designated bank accounts
4. **Smart Contract Execution**: Baray signals blockchain contract to mint/burn tokens
5. **Network Deployment**: Tokens issued on user's chosen network

**Fee Structure:**
- **Selendra Network**: Free minting and transactions (no fees)
- **Other Networks**: Standard blockchain gas fees paid by user
- **Programmable Features**: 0.1-0.5% for advanced smart contract capabilities
- **Banking Integration**: Covered through Baray's integrated pricing
- **Currency Conversion**: Transparent USD/KHR conversion when applicable

### 3.3 Reserve Verification

Reserve verification uses three methods:

1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Weekly cryptographic verification of total reserves
2. **Merkle Trees**: Individual balance verification without revealing account details  
3. **Independent Audits**: Monthly verification by certified accounting firms
4. **Banking Integration**: Real-time balance confirmation through Baray's banking APIs

### 3.4 Multi-Chain Deployment

KHRt operates across multiple blockchain networks through independent contract deployments rather than cross-chain bridges:

- **Independent Contracts**: Separate KHRt token contracts deployed on each supported network
- **Unified Reserve Pool**: All deployments backed by the same physical KHR reserves
- **Coordinated Minting**: Total supply across all chains cannot exceed reserve backing
- **No Bridge Risk**: Eliminates cross-chain bridge attack vectors entirely

**Supported Networks**:
- Selendra (Primary network)
- Ethereum (ERC-20 deployment)
- Polygon (Lower-cost transactions)
- Additional networks based on adoption demand

**Cross-Chain Supply Management**:
```
Total Supply = Selendra Supply + Ethereum Supply + Polygon Supply + ... ≤ Total Reserves
```

Each network maintains independent operations while sharing the same reserve backing, ensuring 1:1 redemption on any supported chain.

### 3.5 Performance Specifications

- **Transaction Finality**: 2-3 seconds on Selendra network
- **Minting Time**: 15 minutes average (deposit to token receipt)
- **Redemption Time**: 30 minutes average (burn to fiat availability)
- **Gas Costs**: <0.1% of transaction value

### 3.6 User Experience and Wallet Integration

**Primary Wallet Support:**
- **Selendra's Bitriel Wallet**: Native integration optimized for Cambodia ecosystem
- **MetaMask/Trust Wallet**: Full compatibility for experienced blockchain users
- **Mobile and Desktop**: Cross-platform availability

**Simplified User Journey:**
1. **Wallet Setup**: Download Bitriel or compatible wallet
2. **Network Selection**: Choose Selendra (free) or other supported networks
3. **Baray Integration**: Connect through familiar banking apps (ABA, ACLEDA)
4. **Instant Minting**: Receive KHRt tokens within 15 minutes
5. **Programmable Use**: Access smart contracts and DeFi protocols

**User Experience Principles:**
- **Familiar Banking**: Leverage existing mobile banking relationships
- **Transparent Costs**: All fees displayed before confirmation
